# ✈️ Airplane Crash Analysis & Visualization

This project analyzes global airplane crash data from 1908 to present to uncover trends related to **weather**, **time of day**, and **accident hotspots**.


## 🧠 Key Objectives
- Analyze patterns in crash timing (year, hour, time of day)
- Identify weather-related crash causes
- Visualize accident hotspots by location
- Explore contributing factors (crew, passengers, survival rates)

## 📊 Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook (`SCT_DS_04.ipynb`)

## 📌 Outputs
- Crash trends over years
- Crashes by time of day
- Weather-related crash count
- Top crash locations bar chart
- Survival rate analysis
